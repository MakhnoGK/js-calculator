# Simple (maybe) HTML/CSS and JavaScript calculator
This project is calculator with basic functionality only. It can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers (integers and decimals).
I try to rewrite code to better with time and when I learn new things about JavaScript. 
**This project stands for "pet" project so it don't worth a dime if you not interested in learning or you just checking my Github for some reason**
